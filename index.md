Please ensure your full name is used when registering as this is needed by building security to let you in.

# Finding the office in Tower42

As you enter Tower42, take the escalators to the building reception.  Upon giving your name you will receive a visitor pass for the building.

Go to the far right and go through building security, your bag will be scanned and you pass through a metal detector.

Once through security, take the escalators immediately to your left - following the blue path.  Walk all the way round to lifts and take the lift to the 24th floor.

At the 24th floor, get out of the lift and cross the hallway.  Take the blue lifts to the 27th floor.  Exiting the lift to your left you will find the Salesforce office.
